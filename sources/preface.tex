\section*{Acknowledgements}
I am very happy to be able to write this section, and to thank the many people who played a part in getting me to this point. Not just this thesis, but much of my life has been a group effort, with wonderful people supporting me in different aspects. And while I hope to have helped them as much as they have helped me, it is still a pleasure to have this opportunity to specifically thank them. \\

Firstly, to the people without whom I would not be me at all. To my parents, Mami and Nico, go the biggest thanks I can give. Mami, not only did you push me to be my best all my life, but you supported me at every stop. This entire thesis is too short to list all the things I am grateful to you for, but fundamentally I want to say thank you for the unconditional love and the needed stern talks to keep things on track when you feel I lost my way. Nico, over the past 13 years you have never imposed your role as a stepdad. But every time I needed help or advice, or just wanted to chat, you were there. I learned so much from your calm way of discussing difficult topics, in particular to listen first and talk later (ok I'm still working on that one). I found a fantastic father figure in you, better than I could ask for. Thank you! And to my siblings, Flo, Elena, Tini and Prince Vince, thank you for all the great times we have together. \\

Tina -- honey -- loving you is my great joy, and has been for the past 5 years. Nobody else has listened to my ramblings about science, DnD, and everything else as intensely as you. I love all the times I learn from you, about fliG, and flagella and cryoEM, and about cross stitch, and dance, and the musical ideas behind the How to Train your Dragon theme. I love the geeky science conversations we have about the internal thermodynamics and chemistry of cheese melting, and I love planning our future together. Thank you for being there for me through everything. \\

To Benni -- my very best friend -- ours is a friendship which has changed me in many ways. You have been my best friend for almost 15 years, even though for 11 of these we have lived in different countries. You taught me very early on that I should not be so stuck in just my ways, but that other perspectives can have just as much value. Because our friendship is not build on mutual interest like most, but on the appreciation for the different interests we have, and on a foundation of the same base values. You are always there for me. Thank you for everything!\\

Now on to the people whose contribution was more directly related to my PhD. First and foremost is of course Laura, the boss. I remember the first few meetings we had, looking at plots which I had studied for the better part of the week, and you were able to pick out the critical points where something was wrong in less than a minute. It took me a long time to realise that it was not just years of experience which made this possible, but the ability to ask critical questions of the information which is presented, to really try and understand the critical points. Out of all the things I learned from you over the last few years, I think this is what will stick with me the most. \\

Next thanks go all the people in our group, but in particular to the people I worked most closely with on the research which makes up this thesis: Ivan and Laura. Ivan, you taught me pretty much all that I know about antinuclei, and were the perfect discussion partner for all aspects of the analysis. And Laura, we worked together so closely on all the implementations in Galprop, the 100s of extra checks, the antideuteron paper, etc. We worked together through many late nights and got to know and like each other much better than I think either of us expected! We were always in the same boat whenever things were difficult, and managed to make it through together. I came to appreciate your unapologetic brand of honesty, by which you immediately get to the core of any subject. And I am very grateful that we became friends. \\

Finally, I want to thank my Master thesis supervisor, Prof. Paul Dauncey. You gave me another chance after I had struggled, otherwise I might not be handing in my PhD thesis today at all.
