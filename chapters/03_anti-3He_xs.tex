The measurement of the \ahe\ inelastic cross section is one of the main results of this thesis. This is the first measurement of this inelastic cross section, which is important not just for nuclear physics, but also for astrophysical searches for physics beyond the standard model, as discussed in section \ref{sec:Intro:AntinucleiGoldenChannel}. Historically, inelastic cross section measurements were performed using fixed target experiments: a beam of the particle of interest with well-determined momentum was isolated, and then fired on a material target with known properties. By measuring the abundance of the particle before and after the target, the cross section could be measured. The difficulty in doing this for antinuclei lies in the production and isolation of an antinuclei beam, since antinuclei production is so rare and has a high $\sqrt{s}$ threshold. Even at the places where antinuclei are produced (at the LHC and at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) \cite{RHIC}), further isolating a beam of such particles is not feasible within current experimental constraints. In fact, out of all antinuclei ($A$>2), this method has only been applied to high energy antideuterons \cite{Binon:1970yu, Denisov:1971im}, at the U-70 proton synchrotron in the 70s, for particles at very high momenta of 13 GeV/$c$ and 25 GeV/$c$. Recently, roughly half a century later, the new measurement technique using the antiparticle-to-particle ratio has been shown to be able to measure the antideuteron inelastic cross section down to 500 MeV/$c$ \cite{antideuteronXS}. This measurement has now been expanded to \ahe\ \cite{antiHe3XS} and \atrit\ , and a separate complementary method (TPC/TOF method) has enabled the use of the high statistics Pb--Pb data to boost the measurements' precision. Both these new methods rely on quantifying the absorption of antinuclei as they travel through the detector material, rather than a dedicated target. The disadvantage of this approach is that the detector material is optimised to have little material budget as possible, as to not interfere with the particles of interest. Nevertheless, these methods allow us to further our knowledge of antinuclei inelastic cross sections for the first time in half a century.

\subsection{Physics motivation and overview of the analysis method}
\ahe\ nuclei are a promising probe for indirect dark matter searches, but in order to understand any potential signal, it is necessary to know their disappearance probability as they travel to earth from their cosmic sources, as is extensively discussed in sections \ref{sec:Intro:AntinucleiGoldenChannel} and \ref{sec:WIMPS}. While this is the astrophysical motivation for this measurement, it also has applications in nuclear physics, in particular for improved modelling of antinuclei propagation through the detector material using Geant4. This is particularly important in the low energy region ($lessim$ 2 GeV/$c$), where Glauber model calculations are less reliable. Measurements of (anti)nuclei production rely on efficiencies to be well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulation, which requires the inelastic cross sections as input. \\ 
The analysis methods used to measure the inelastic interaction cross section are laid out below. 
\subsubsection{Antiparticle-to-particle ratio method}
The detailed steps of this method are described in section \ref{sec:ExperimentAndMethod}.\\
The antiparticle-to-particle method is based on using the ratio of antiparticles to particles as an observable for the cross section. This works since at LHC energies, the relative amounts of matter and antimatter which are produced are well known. They are produced in almost equal amounts, and therefore dividing the number of antiparticles by the number of particles acts as a normalization of the number of antiparticles produced\footnote{This method does not in principle require equal amounts of matter and antimatter, merely a very precise knowledge of the ratio of antimatter to matter which is produced.}. The detector material itself acts as a target. Since antiparticles and particles have the same interactions with the detector material apart from annihilation, uncertainties due to particle identification and tracking cancel to a large extent. 
\subsubsection{TOF-TPC matching method}\label{sec:TOFTPCMethod}
The second method for measuring \sigmainel\ uses the fact that over a wide momentum range, \ahe\ can be clearly identified in both the TPC and the TOF detectors. We can therefore check the amount of \ahe\ nuclei present in the TPC, and how many of those make it all the way to the TOF detector. This method works akin to a fixed target experiment, in that a "beam" is identified by measuring \ahe\ in the TPC, this beam is then fired upon the "target", which in this case is the space frame and the TRD. Some of the nuclei will annihilate, while the others which make it through will generate a matching TOF hit, thus allowing us to quantify the "beam" loss between two detectors. \\
The advantage of this method is that only the antiparticles are required; no specific assumptions about the antimatter-to-matter ratio need to be assumed and tested. This also means that no correction for secondary nuclei from material spallation needs to be applied, since the origin of the \ahe\ has no impact on the result\footnote{Also, there are no secondary \ahe\ nuclei from material spallation, so the secondary correction is even less important.}. The disadvantage is that the acceptance of the TOF detector limits the applicability of this method to higher momenta, so it is more difficult to measure the low energy rise of the inelastic cross section. \\

The measurement of \sigmainel\ using the TPC-TOF matching method is thus complementary to the antiparticle-to-particle method described above. This analysis was not carried out as part of this work, but ties in closely with the results shown both in this chapter and in chapter \ref{sec:AntinucleiInTheCosmos}, and is thus described here. The measurement is also shown together with the measurement using the antimatter-to-matter inelastic cross section. More details about the analysis can be found in \cite{PavelAN, antiHe3XS}.

\subsection{Secondary correction}
In order to extract the cross section from the antiparticle-to-particle ratio, only particles produced at the primary vertex must be considered. Thus, secondary particles need to be accounted for by using template fits, as described in section \ref{sec:Meth:secondaryCorr}. \\

The template fits done for the secondary correction of $^3\mathrm{He}$ are shown in figure \ref{fig:Template_fits_he}. The cut on |DCA$_z$| < 1 cm was chosen in order to include more secondaries, and improve the statistical constraints on the fit. As can be seen, in the second bin there is a slight shoulder towards the negative side of 0, where the fitted material template exceeds the data, which is the biggest systematic discrepancy of the fits. This effect has been investigated, and since i) it is outside of the signal region and ii) it is within the uncertainties, it was concluded to be a negligible effect.

\subsection{Results}
After all the corrections are applied, we can now obtain the final \ratio\ and the corresponding \sigmainel\ , which are shown in figure \ref{fig:Ahe_sigma_inel_pp}. The measurement is in agreement with the parameterization used in Geant4 at a significance of slightly above 1$\sigma$. The lowest momentum bin shows a hint at a steeper rise than the parameterization. The second bin is shown as an upper limit since the uncertainties reached below 0, which would be an unphysical value for the cross section. \\

This represents the first measurement of \sigmainel\ .

The discontinuity at $p/Z$ = 1 GeV/$c$ is due to the additional requirement of a TOF hit, thus requiring tracks to traverse more material.

Open points are from the analysis using the TPC only for particle identification, while closed points require a matching hit in the TOF in addition to the TPC, which therefore has a different averaged material value. The lines show the parameterization used in Geant4.}

The measurement of \sigmainel\ done in Pb--Pb collisions using the TOF-to-TPC method is shown for comparison in figure \ref{fig:Ahe_sigma_inel_PbPb}. The much increased statistics available for the Pb--Pb data sample results in much reduced statistical uncertainty. The two measurements deliver consistent results in the overlapping momentum region.
